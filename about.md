  Tahsin-Ul-Abrar
</p>

I am Tahsin-Ul-Abrar (তাহসিনুল আবরার), but most people know me as Tahsin Abrar, the short form of my name from the facebook profile.

I currently live in Dhaka, but my hometown is in Feni, Bangladesh. I’ve completed B.Sc.Engg. in Computer Science & Telecommunication Engineering (CSTE) from Noakhali Science & Technology University (NSTU), Bangladesh. I’ve learned many things from my trainers and teachers. Specially thanks to Mian Zadid Rusdid Sir for guiding me.

I’ve learned many new things like: Big Data, SMAC etc. when I was a trainee in the Fast Track Future Leader (FTFL) Training, a project under the supervision of ICT ministry at Bangladesh Computer Council (BCC), Agargaon, Dhaka.

Now, I’m working as a Junior Programmer at Sunhillworks Limited, Bangladesh. By profession and by passion, I am a Web Application developer. And I love to work with PHP, specially Laravel and WordPress.

I am also a Co-founder & contributor writer at [BigganBangla.com](http://bigganbangla.com), a science based bangla website.
